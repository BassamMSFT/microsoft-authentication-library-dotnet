“The Azure Portal had a mighty task of migrating from ADAL to MSAL with the constraint of maintaining the current Auth architecture. The MSAL team followed a very systematic migration process. They understood the Azure Portal's auth architecture, recommended solutions that fit in the current architecture. Following those guidelines, the Portal team was able to build a successful prototype, both teams did a final design review and eventually the changes were formalized for production. All questions, issues and blockers that came along the way were dealt with in a timely manner and with great patience and communication. Eventually the Azure Portal was able to successfully migrate from ADAL to MSAL without causing any outages in production.” -Akshay
