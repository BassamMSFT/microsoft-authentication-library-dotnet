# Errors associated with Web Account Manager (WAM)

Generally, errors generated by the MSAL component that interacts with the Web Account Manager (WAM) are [automatically converted](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/d25f45f7e356bd92986e412dd68b5d341343aa6a/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client/Platforms/Features/RuntimeBroker/WamAdapters.cs#L56) to an instance of <xref:Microsoft.Identity.Client.MsalException>. This enables developers to not worry about the internals and instead handle errors through idiomatic .NET constructs. However, for additional deep dives, developers will often need to investigate specific error messages.

The table below highlights some of the most common errors along with potential mititgation strategies.

| Error Code | Description | Mitigation |
|:---------  |:------------|:-----------|
| 529290376  | Account credentials missing in WAM, and should be removed. | |

## Unlisted errors

Because WAM is a relatively new component, when errors occur we recommend logging data from [`AdditionalExceptionData`](xref:Microsoft.Identity.Client.MsalException.AdditionalExceptionData*) and [logging a bug](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/issues). We will document the issue as soon as possible.
