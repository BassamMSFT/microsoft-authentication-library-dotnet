# Active Directory Federation Services support in MSAL.NET

Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) in Windows Server enables you to add OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 based authentication and authorization to applications you are developing. Those applications can, then, authenticate users directly against AD FS. For more information, read [AD FS Scenarios for Developers](/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/overview/ad-fs-openid-connect-oauth-flows-scenarios).

Microsoft Authentication Library for .NET (MSAL.NET) supports two scenarios for authenticating against AD FS:

- MSAL.NET talks to Azure Active Directory, which itself is *federated* with AD FS.
- MSAL.NET talks **directly** to an ADFS authority. This is only supported from AD FS 2019 and above. One of the scenarios this highlights is [Azure Stack](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/azure-stack/) support

## Cases where identity providers are federated with Azure AD

MSAL.NET supports talking to Azure AD, which itself signs-in managed users (users managed in Azure AD), or federated users (users managed by another identity provider, which, in the case we are interested is federated through ADFS). MSAL.NET does not know about the fact that users are federated. As far as itâ€™s concerned, it talks to Azure AD.

The [authority](/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-client-applications) you'll use in the case is the usual authority (common, organizations, or tenanted).

### Acquiring a token interactively

When you call the the `AcquireTokenInteractive`,the user experience is typically: 

- The user enter their upn (or the account or `loginHint` is provided part of the call to <xref:Microsoft.Identity.Client.IPublicClientApplication.AcquireTokenAsync(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{System.String})>)
- Azure AD displays briefly "Taking you to your organization's page"
- Azure AD then redirects the user to the sign-in page of the identity provider (usually customized with the logo of the organization)

Supported ADFS versions in this federated scenario are ADFS v2 , ADFS v3 (Windows Server 2012 R2) and ADFS v4 (ADFS 2016)

### Acquiring a token using `AcquireTokenByIntegratedAuthentication` or `AcquireTokenByUsernamePassword`

When acquiring a token using the `AcquireTokenByIntegratedAuthentication` or `AcquireTokenByUsernamePassword` methods, MSAL.NET gets the identity provider to contact based on the username.  MSAL.NET receives a [SAML 1.1 token](/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-saml-tokens) after contacting the identity provider.  MSAL.NET then provides the SAML token to Azure AD as a user assertion (similar to the [on-behalf-of flow](../web-apps-apis/on-behalf-of-flow.md) to get back a JWT.

## Case where MSAL connects directly to ADFS

MSAL.NET supports connecting to AD FS 2019, which is Open ID Connect compliant and understands PKCE and scopes. This support requires that a service pack [KB 4490481](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4490481/windows-10-update-kb4490481) is applied to Windows Server. When connecting directly to AD FS, the authority you'll want to use to build your application is similar to `https://mysite.contoso.com/adfs/`.

Currently, there are no plans to support a direct connection to:

- AD FS 16, as it doesn't support PKCE and still uses resources, not scope
- AD FS v2, which is not OIDC-compliant.

 If you need to support scenarios requiring a direct connection to AD FS 2016, use the latest version of [Azure Active Directory Authentication Library](../azuread-dev/active-directory-authentication-libraries.md#microsoft-supported-client-libraries). When you have upgraded your on-premises system to AD FS 2019, you'll be able to use MSAL.NET.

However for MSAL.NET we have no plans to support a direct connection to ADFS 2016 (it does not support PKCE and still uses resources, not scope). When you have upgraded your on-premise system to ADFS 2019, you'll be able to use MSAL.NET.

MSAL does not support Integrated Windows Authentication (by calling `AcquireTokenByIntegratedWindowsAuth`) directly to ADFS.
