# Handling of personally-identifiable information in MSAL.NET

## What MSAL will never log

- tokens (access tokens, id tokens, refresh tokens, client assertions generated by MSAL etc.)
- passwords (in any case MSAL is only given the password in the Username / Password (ROPC) flow. MSAL does not have access to the password entered by the user in a browser)
- authorization codes
- PKCE code
- successful network responses from the /authorize or /token endpoint (they might contain tokens or auth codes) 
- network requests (they might contain passwords)
- private keys of certs

## What MSALs consider as PII

- username
- login hint
- id token claims (note that MSAL only parses the id token, it never looks at access token / refresh token) - this includes names, address and other user details.
- authorization uri (it may contain a login hint)
- Object ID aka `oid`

## What MSALs do not consider as PII

- IDs related to an organization / tenant (not the user) - tenant id, directory id, directory name (e.g. contonso.onmicrosoft.com)
- authority 
- client / application id
- exception messages and stack traces, including error codes coming from AAD
- HTTP details other than request / response (e.g. HTTP status codes, payload size etc.)
- correlation id
- runtime details (OS name, .NET version)
-
