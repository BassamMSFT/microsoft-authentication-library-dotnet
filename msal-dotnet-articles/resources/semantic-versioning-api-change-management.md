# Semantic versioning and API change management

MSAL.NET has adopted [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), the industry standard for OSS projects.

Per the semantic versioning spec, breaking changes (a.k.a. incompatible changes) will only be released with a major version bump. When that happens, we will document that change in the [release notes](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/releases).
