MSAL.NET and ADAL SDKs in general follow semantic versioning and:
-  major/minor releases are published twice per year. A feature could be included in a release or not dependent on the complexity and integration of the feature.
- ADAL SDK maintenance patches are typically released once per month (unless urgent fixes are required ASAP), these include live site issues and security fixes for the currently supported released versions. Some of the security issues are back ported to the last major.minor release
