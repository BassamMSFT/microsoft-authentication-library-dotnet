# Proof-of-Possession (PoP) tokens

Bearer tokens are the norm in modern identity flows, however they are vulnerable to being stolen and used to access a protected resource.

Proof-of-Possession (PoP) tokens mitigate this threat via 2 mechanisms:

- They are bound to the user/machine that wants to access a protected resource, via a public/private key pair
- They are bound to the protected resource itself, i.e. a token that is used to access `GET https://contoso.com/transactions` cannot be used to access `GET https://contoso.com/tranfer/100`

For more details, see [RFC 7800](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7800).

## Proof-of-Possession for confidential clients

See the [full code sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnetcore-daemon-v2/tree/master/4-Call-OwnApi-Pop) show casing a daemon app using AcquireTokenForClient with PoP to call an API protected with Proof-of-Possession.

> [!NOTE]
> Proof-of-Possession is still experimental for confidential clients.

Example implementation:

```csharp
// The PoP token will be bound to this user / machine and to `GET https://www.contoso.com/tranfers` (the query params are not bound).
// Request URI is required in the PopAuthenticationConfiguration constructor
PopAuthenticationConfiguration popConfig = new PopAuthenticationConfiguration(new Uri("https://www.contoso.com/tranfers?user=me"));

//HttpMethod is optional
popConfig.HttpMethod = HttpMethod.Get;

// Server nonce is optional
popConfig.Nonce = "nonce";

//PopCryptoProvider is optional. Do not set to use MSAL's internal implementation.
popConfig.PopCryptoProvider = new ECDCertificatePopCryptoProvider();
          
var cca = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(CLIENT_ID)
    .WithExperimentalFeatures()     // Currently PoP for confidential client is an experimental feature
    .Build();


result = await cca
      .AcquireTokenForClient (new[] { "scope"})
      .WithProofOfPossession(popConfig)
      .ExecuteAsync()
      .ConfigureAwait(false);

//The PoP token will be available on the AuthenticationResult.AccessToken returned form the acquire token call

//To create the auth header
var authHeader = new AuthenticationHeaderValue(result.TokenType, result.AccessToken);
```

## How does MSAL manage the keys

An RSA key pair of length 2048 is generated by MSAL and stored in memory which will be cycled every 8 hours. For details, see the implementation in [PoPProviderFactory](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/300fba16bd8096dceba3684311550b4b52a56177/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client/AuthScheme/PoP/PoPProviderFactory.cs#L18) and [InMemoryCryptoProvider](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/main/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client/AuthScheme/PoP/InMemoryCryptoProvider.cs).

## Can I use PoP?

In order to use Proof-of-Possession in MSAL, your web API first needs to be protected with PoP as described in this [wiki](https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/wiki/SignedHttpRequest-aka-PoP-(Proof-of-Possession)).

If you are writing a new API, you can protect it using PoP exclusively and require clients to generate PoP tokens.
If you are upgrading an existing API, consider supporting both Bearer and PoP tokens for a while to allow clients to migrate. MSAL supports requesting both Bearer and PoP tokens for the same resource.

## Bring your own key

The PoP feature in MSAL allows users to provide their own key management for additional control over cryptographic operations. The interface is an abstraction over the asymmetric key operations needed by PoP that encapsulates a pair of public and private keys and some typical crypto operations. All symmetric operations use SHA256.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Two properties and the sign method on this interface will be called at different times but MUST return details of the same private / public key pair, i.e. do not change to a different key pair mid way. It is best to make this class immutable. Ideally there should be a single public and private key pair associated with a machine, so that implementers of this interface should consider exposing a singleton. See [IPoPCryptoProvider interface](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/master/src/client/Microsoft.Identity.Client/AuthScheme/PoP/IPoPCryptoProvider.cs), [example RSA key implementation](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/9895855ac4fcf52893fbc2b06ee20ea3eda1549a/tests/Microsoft.Identity.Test.Integration.netfx/HeadlessTests/PoPTests.cs#L503), and [example ECD key implementation](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/9895855ac4fcf52893fbc2b06ee20ea3eda1549a/tests/Microsoft.Identity.Test.Common/Core/Helpers/ECDCertificatePopCryptoProvider.cs#L11).

## How to add more claims / How do I create the Signed HTTP Request (SHR) part of the PoP token myself?

If you want to do key management and to create the SHR yourself,  see [this example implementation](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-dotnet/blob/300fba16bd8096dceba3684311550b4b52a56177/tests/Microsoft.Identity.Test.Integration.netfx/HeadlessTests/PoPTests.cs#L286).

## Proof-of-Possession for public clients

Proof-of-Possession on public client flows can be achieved with the use of the updated [Windows broker](../acquiring-tokens/desktop-mobile/wam.md) in MSAL 4.52.0 and above. Contrary to the confidential client flow, it is not possible to provide your own key to sign the PoP token.

Example implementation:

```csharp
// Required for the use of the broker (on all supported platforms except .NET 6 Windows and above)
using Microsoft.Identity.Client.Broker; 

// The PoP token will be bound to this user / machine and to `GET https://www.contoso.com/tranfers` (the query parameters are not bound).
// The nonce is a requirement in this case and needs to be acquired from the resource before using this API.

// Server nonce is required
string nonce = "nonce";

//HttpMethod is optional
HttpMethod method = HttpMethod.Get;

//Request URI
Uri requestUri = new Uri("https://www.contoso.com/tranfers?user=me");
          
var pca = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(CLIENT_ID)
    .WithBroker()  //Enables the use of broker on public clients only
    .Build();

//Interactive request
AuthenticationResult result = await pca
      .AcquireTokenInteractive(new[] { "scope" })
      .WithProofOfPossession(nonce, method, requestUri)
      .ExecuteAsync()
      .ConfigureAwait(false);

// The PoP token will be available in the AuthenticationResult.AccessToken returned form the acquire token call

//To create the auth header
var authHeader = new AuthenticationHeaderValue(result.TokenType, result.AccessToken);

//Silent request
var accounts = await pca.GetAccountsAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);
var result = await pca.AcquireTokenSilent(new[] { "scope" }, accounts.FirstOrDefault())
       .WithProofOfPossession(nonce, method, requestUri)
       .ExecuteAsync()
       .ConfigureAwait(false);

```
